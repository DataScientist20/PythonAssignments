What is mutability in Python ?\n","- Mutability in Python refers to the ability of an object to be modified after it is created. Mutable objects can be changed in place, meaning their content can be altered without creating a new object."],"metadata":{"id":"XpNdnU2UCXWQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n","- **Lists:**\n","Designed for storing collections of items that may need to be modified. Their mutability allows for efficient addition, removal, and modification of elements. This flexibility comes at the cost of slightly more memory overhead and potentially slower iteration compared to tuples.\n","- **Tuples:**\n","Primarily used for grouping related data together, especially when the data should not be changed. Immutability ensures data integrity and allows tuples to be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets, which require hashable objects. Tuples are more memory-efficient and can be faster to iterate through than lists."],"metadata":{"id":"I0P0Ch91Dx2p"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n","- The 'is' is termed as the identity operator. The == operator is used to compare the equality of objects. The is operator is used to check if different variables are pointing to the same object in memory. The == operator is used in Python when the values of the operands are equal."],"metadata":{"id":"zsZj7pnVFS77"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q8. What are logical operators in Python ?\n","- Logical operators in Python are used to combine or modify conditional statements. They work with boolean values (True or False) and return a boolean result. Python has three main logical operators: and, or, and not.\n","- 1) and: Returns True if both operands are True, otherwise returns False.\n","- 2) or: Returns True if at least one of the operands is True, otherwise returns False.\n","- 3)not: Returns True if the operand is False, and False if the operand is True.

What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n","- Implicit type casting\n","happens automatically when the interpreter converts data types without user intervention, such as during operations involving mixed data types.\n","- Explicit type casting\n","occurs when the user manually converts the data type using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), bool(), etc.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"mSoUwBp3Hxvc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q11.  What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n","- A conditional statement describes the relationship between two events based on certain conditions.

How does the elif statement work ?\n","- The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions.

What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n","- The for loop provides its users with a concise way in which they can write the loop structure. It provides a very easy to debug and short looping structure. The while loop is a type of continuous flow statement that basically allows the repeated execution of a code on the basis of any given Boolean condition.\n","- In general, you should use a for loop when you know how many times the loop should run. If you want the loop to break based on a condition other than the number of times it runs, you should use a while loop."],"metadata":{"id":"x_Og6WpXJyIY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop\n","- Asking the user to enter a phone number until it's in the right format: This is the ideal situation for a while loop.
